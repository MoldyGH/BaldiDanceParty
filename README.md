# BaldiDanceParty

a mod

# How to compile

this mod uses bepinex so im assuming you have bepinex installed in your baldi's basics plus directory

create a folder in root called "libs" and put all the dlls in the baldi's basics plus managed folder (DATA/Managed) and get all the dlls from your bepinex core (BepInEx/core) and put them in there too

create an empty folder called "builds" you dont need to put anything here

then open the solution and go to the build tab and hit "Build Solution"

you have successfully built the mod :gamer:
